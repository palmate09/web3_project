Academic Attestation on Aptos
1. Description
This repository contains a simple smart contract written in Move for the Aptos blockchain. The AcademicAttestation module allows users to store a single academic achievement or reference on-chain. Each attestation is linked directly to a user's account and consists of a reference (e.g., a recommender's name or institution) and a publication (e.g., a paper title or degree name).

The current functionality includes:

create_attestation: Allows a user to create and store one attestation under their account.

get_attestation: A public view function to read the details of an attestation for a given account address.

2. Vision
The long-term vision for this project is to build a decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof system for managing academic and professional credentials. By leveraging the Aptos blockchain, we can create a global, open database where individuals have full ownership of their verified achievements. This would reduce fraud, simplify verification processes for employers and institutions, and empower individuals to securely share their qualifications.

3. Future Scope
The current contract is a foundational proof-of-concept. The following features are planned for future development to realize the full vision:

Multiple Attestations per Account: Implement a storage solution (e.g., using a Table) to allow users to store an unlimited number of attestations, each with a unique ID.

Update and Delete Functionality: Add entry functions to allow users to modify or remove existing attestations, giving them full control over their on-chain data.

Verification System: Introduce a role-based system where trusted institutions (e.g., universities) can sign and verify attestations, adding a layer of authenticity.

On-Chain Events: Emit events for creating, updating, and deleting attestations. This is crucial for off-chain services and frontends to index and display data efficiently.

Categorization and Tagging: Allow users to add categories or tags to their attestations (e.g., "Education," "Publication," "Conference") to better organize their credentials.

Access Control: Develop a mechanism for users to grant temporary, read-only access to their credentials to third parties (like potential employers) in a secure manner.

4. Contract Address
Once deployed on the Aptos network, the contract address will be updated here.
